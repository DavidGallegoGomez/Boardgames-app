# Welcome to Boardgamia :game_die:

Boardgamia a new board games based social network developed by Ironhackers David Gallego and Guillermo Lucena.

In this app you will be able to create a profile where you can have lists of games and follow users. In addition you will have a collaborative database of games that will be enhanced by users day by day. You will also be able to search through that database to find your favorite games of discover new games based on different filter options. You will also be able to comment on games and see the comment and ratings that users gave to each of the games. But remember, you can only comment once per game, after all we all like to read opinions from different people.

But not only that! This amazing app will allow you to create and join events to be able to meet other players that usually play around you.
There is also a statistics page where you can see information like how many players are there at are register on the app and very close to you. You will also be able to see what are the 5 favorite games of the users and which are the most wanted games.

But **what if you want to play with a friend that lives far far away?**, There is no problem at all, the app will allow you to store a URL that you can share with your friend to organise a video chat game.

## Your profile

In your profile you will be able to organise you games through these lists:

- **Owned games**: This list allow you to have a list where you can show all the games you have. Start now filling your list and see if you have enough games to become a gold member, silver member or just start as a bronze member.

- **WishList**: The truth is that there are so many games out there that is hard to have all of them, and the more you play the more games you discover that you want to have. Go on and tell your friends what would be a great gift :gift: for you on your coming birthday. Also a great way to know what would be the present that would really make your friend happy :heart_eyes:

- **Exchange list**: We all have some games that we have played so much that we dont want to keep playing because there are so many more out there. Go on and fill the list with the games you want to exchange. This is the best and cheapest way to renew your owned games list without spending lots of money :money_with_wings: :money_with_wings:

## Policies and aims of the app

1. These app aims to create a friendly and welcoming place for everyone. Please keep your language polite and don't use discriminative or undecent language.

2. The power of this app comes from user. If you find any mistake of missing information on the games of the database go on and update the information so we can all find the rules that we lost long time ago :wink:

3. What if there is a game missing? Go on and create the game so the list will end up having all the games in the world.

### Next developments

These are some of the improvements we are working on to improve the usage of the app:

- **Users filter**: This will allow to find the users easily.
- **Messaging platform**: We want you to be able to open chats so you can communicate to other users.
- **Events filter**: So you will be able to find the events that are happening close to you. Or the events happening for a particular game.
